This is a brief introduction of what I have done thus far through the Odin Project.
I have so far
1. Learned how to set up linux using VMware. 
2. I have set up both git and Github accounts 
3. started learning how to clone, edit, add and commit repositories
4. Basics of HTML were explored
This current project is titled Recipes
It is going to be a simple HTML only site that will be reviisted through out the courses
to be updated and added to.
